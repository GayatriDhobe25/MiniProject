                    <h2>Pet Care</h2>
                    <p>Just like human beings, pets need ready access to water in order to survive. Always provide a clean, fresh bowl of water to all animals in your care. Make it accessible by placing it near their food bowl, and remember to refill your pet's water bowl at least two times a day. This will keep your pet cool, hydrated, and healthy.</p>

                    <h2>Poultry Health Care</h2>
                    <p>Poultry can develop resistance to some parasites and a low level of parasitism is normal, but they become a problem when the balance tips in the parasite's favor and overwhelm the bird. Differences among strains of the same pathogenic microbes can cause different symptoms and differences in severity of a disease.</p>
