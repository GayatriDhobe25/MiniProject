       Behavior Patterns

There are millions of different species of animals, and each species behaves somewhat differently. Nevertheless, there are common patterns of behavior exhibited by many species, and a few behavior patterns that are exhibited by all species. Since all species need to reproduce, eat, and try not to be eaten by someone else, all species exhibit some type of reproductive behavior, foraging (eating) behavior, and defensive behavior. Over time, natural selection has also favored other behavior patterns that help species accomplish these basic goals, including communication behavior, territorial behavior, dispersal behavior, and social behavior.
Reproductive Behavior

Although some animals are able to reproduce asexually (such as some insects and a few species of lizards), most animals must find a mate in order to reproduce. In many cases, one of the individuals, usually the male, tries to attract a mate by performing a courtship display. This is often a visual display, as is the case with the peacock and many species of coral reef fish. Studies have shown that the females select males partly on the basis of their courtship displays. Scientists believe that vigorous and brightly colored displays might signal to the female that the male is strong and healthy. Thus, mating behavior plays an important role in determining which genes get passed on to the next generation.
Foraging Behavior

Animals exhibit several different types of foraging behavior. Some animals are quite selective in what they eat. These animals are called foraging specialists. For example, the diet of the lynx consists primarily of snowshoe hares. Some species of insects feed only on a single plant species; they are the ultimate feeding specialists. Other animals are generalists, eating a wide variety of food types. An example of a foraging generalist is the opossum, which eats everything from insects and berries to garbage. It is thought that natural selection has favored many animals to forage in an efficient manner. This means that the animals make feeding choices that maximize the amount of energy they can obtain in the shortest time possible. This type of foraging, sometimes referred to as "optimal foraging," leaves the animal with more time and energy for other important activities, such as finding a mate or caring for offspring.
